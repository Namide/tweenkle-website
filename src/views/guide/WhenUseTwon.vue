    <h1 class="example-title">When use twon?</h1>
    <p>
      Twon is designed for pure Javascript animations. You can interpolate WebGL
      animation with WebGL render library and Twon. You can use twon too for
      dynamic animation like animations changed in real time by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid using twon or other tweening library for HTML precalculated
      animations or transitions. For that it's better using CSS animatio or
      transitions and combine transform and opacity modification. The framerate
      and weight will be better.
